## Installation | How to use the Bot

 **1.** First you need to register a **Rich Presence Application** with [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)

 **2.** Make a **new application** *The name of the app will be the main name for the Rich Presence*
 
 **3.** Enable Rich Presence for your app and assets, *the images, make sure to save it!*
 
 **4.** Edit the config file with the information from your newly registered app

 **5.** Run **`richpresence.exe`** (it should open a **CMD WINDOW**)

 **6.** Discord should show the game on your profile

## **NOTES:**



If it is not showing up: Make sure that you have enabled Game-visibility in your Discord Settings, you can disable all games


You can make a new Desktop by pressing `WIN + SHIFT + D` and then you can move the **CMD WINDOW** to there.

You can copy a **Shortcut-File**/**Linking-File** of the exe in the start up Folder, to automatically start the Rich-Presence when booting the PC. To get to this Folder Type: `WIN + R` and then `shell:startup`  --> Enter
